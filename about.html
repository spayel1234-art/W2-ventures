<h2>Our Story</h2>

<p class="small">
Whispering Wick began as a quiet love for handcrafted details — slow moments,
warm light, and objects that feel personal.
</p>

<p class="small">
Each candle is individually crafted in small batches, focusing on form,
balance, and emotion. We believe candles are not just décor — they are
experiences.
</p>

<p class="small">
From sculpted silhouettes to floral inspirations, every piece is designed
to feel thoughtful, intentional, and gift-worthy.
